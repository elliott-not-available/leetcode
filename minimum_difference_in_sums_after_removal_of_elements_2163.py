class Solution:
    def minimumDifference(self, nums: list[int]) -> int:

        # Return the minimum difference possible between the sums of the two parts after the removal of n elements.

        # 3n = length
        # subsequence (made by removing / respects order)
        # remove n, left with 2n
        # sum_first, sum_second, diff = sumfirst - sum_second

        # find min diff
